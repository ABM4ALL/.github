ABM4ALL is a developing community among agent-based modelers for sharing ideas and resources. 
Currently, the projects are created and maintained by *Songmin Yu* and *Zhanyi Hou*. 

Our starting project is **Melodie**, a general framework for developing agent-based models (ABMs) in Python. 
For details, please find its [documentation page](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/index.html), 
including a [tutorial](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/tutorial.html) 
explaining how an agent-based [covid contagion model](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagion) 
can be developed with **Melodie** step by step. 

We really hope this page is useful for you, and most importantly, 
brings you the interest to join the ABM community! 
If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us!
