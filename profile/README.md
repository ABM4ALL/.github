Hi:wave: Welcome to ABM4ALL!

ABM4ALL is a developing community among agent-based modelers for sharing ideas and resources. 
Currently, the projects are created and maintained by *Songmin Yu* and *Zhanyi Hou*. 

  * [Melodie](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/Melodie) - a general framework for developing agent-based models (ABMs) in Python. 
  * [MelodieStudio](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/MelodieStudio) - a package developed in parallel with **Melodie** which interacts with the `Melodie.Visualizer` module and visualizes the simulation results in the browser.
  * [Documentation](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/index.html), 
including a [tutorial](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/tutorial.html) 
explaining how an agent-based [covid contagion model](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagion) 
can be developed with **Melodie** step by step. 
  * A series of example models showing how different modules are implemented:
    * `Grid` &rarr; CovidGridContagion [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidGridContagion)] [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_grid_contagion.html)]
    * `Network` &rarr; CovidNetworkContagion [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidNetworkContagion)] [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_network_contagion.html)]
    * `Calibrator` &rarr; CovidContagionCalibrator [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagionCalibrator)] [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_contagion_calibrator.html)]
    * `Visualizer` and `MelodieStudio` &rarr; CovidGridContagionVisual [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidGridContagionVisual)] 
and CovidNetworkContagionVisual [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidNetworkContagionVisual)] [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_contagion_visual.html)]

We really hope ABM4ALL is useful for you, and most importantly, 
brings you the interest to join the ABM community!
