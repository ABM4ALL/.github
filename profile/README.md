Hi, Welcome to ABM4ALL!

ABM4ALL is a developing community among agent-based modelers for sharing ideas and resources. 
Currently, the projects are created and maintained by *Songmin Yu* and *Zhanyi Hou*. 

  * [Melodie](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/Melodie) - a general framework for developing agent-based models (ABMs) in Python. 
  * [MelodieStudio](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/MelodieStudio) - a package developed in parallel with **Melodie** which interacts with the `Melodie.Visualizer` module and visualizes the simulation results in the browser.

Please note that:

  * At the moment, the latest example for understanding Melodie (since version 1.0.0) is [DatingMarket](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/DatingMarket). It is an example developed in combination with [tab2dict](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/tab2dict), a tool that supports loading, retrieving, and collecting data in developing ABMs. 
  * The [documentation](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/index.html), and earlier [tutorial](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/tutorial.html) for the [covid contagion model](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagion) need to be updated, as well as the following examples. If you want to try running them, please use version 0.7.0 of Melodie. 
    * `Grid` &rarr; CovidGridContagion [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidGridContagion)] [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_grid_contagion.html)]
    * `Network` &rarr; CovidNetworkContagion [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidNetworkContagion)] [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_network_contagion.html)]
    * `Calibrator` &rarr; CovidContagionCalibrator [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagionCalibrator)] [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_contagion_calibrator.html)]
    * `Trainer` &rarr; RockPaperScissorsTrainer [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/RockPaperScissorsTrainer)] [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/rock_paper_scissors.html)]
    * `Visualizer` and `MelodieStudio` &rarr; CovidGridContagionVisual [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidGridContagionVisual)] 
and CovidNetworkContagionVisual [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidNetworkContagionVisual)] [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_contagion_visual.html)]
    * `ABMFrameworkComparison` &rarr; to compare the three Python packages - Mesa, AgentPy, and Melodie - we develop the same agent-based covid contagion model with all of them. [[code](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/ABMFrameworkComparison)] [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/framework_comparison.html)]

We really hope ABM4ALL is useful for you, and most importantly, brings you the interest to join the ABM community!
