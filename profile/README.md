Hi:wave: Welcome to ABM4ALL!

ABM4ALL is a developing community among agent-based modelers for sharing ideas and resources. 
Currently, the projects are created and maintained by *Songmin Yu* and *Zhanyi Hou*. 

  * [Melodie](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/Melodie) - a general framework for developing agent-based models (ABMs) in Python. 
  * [Documentation](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/index.html), 
including a [tutorial](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/tutorial.html) 
explaining how an agent-based [covid contagion model](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagion) 
can be developed with **Melodie** step by step. 
  * A series of example models showing how different modules are implemented:
    * [CovidGridContagion](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidGridContagion) --> `Grid` module
    * [CovidNetworkContagion](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidNetworkContagion) --> `Network` module
    * [CovidGridContagionVisual](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidGridContagionVisual) 
and [CovidNetworkContagionVisual](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidNetworkContagionVisual) --> `Visualizer` and `MelodieStudio` module
    * [CovidContagionCalibrator](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagionCalibrator) --> `Calibrator` module

We really hope ABM4ALL is useful for you, and most importantly, 
brings you the interest to join the ABM community!
